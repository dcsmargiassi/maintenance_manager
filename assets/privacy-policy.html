  <h1>Privacy Policy for Vehicle Record Tracker</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 7, 2025</p>

  <p>Vehicle Record Tracker (“we”, “our”, or “us”) values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, store, and use your information.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect limited personal information necessary for account creation and authentication. This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Email address</strong> (stored in cleartext to facilitate login and account recovery)</li>
    <li><strong>First name, last name, and username</strong> (encrypted on the backend to protect your personal data)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All vehicle and fuel data you enter is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted or stored externally.</p>
  <p>We also collect anonymized analytics data to better understand app usage and improve the user experience.</p>
  
  <h2>Use of Firebase Firestore</h2>
  <p>We use Firebase Firestore to manage account creation and authentication data securely. Your email is stored in cleartext, while your first name, last name, and username are encrypted on the backend before storage to enhance security.</p>
  <p>Firebase may collect metadata such as device information and usage logs as part of its service operation. No vehicle or fuel data is stored in Firebase Firestore.</p>

  <h2>Data Usage</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Account-related data (email, encrypted personal details) is securely stored using Firebase Firestore.</li>
    <li>Vehicle and fuel information remains on your device only.</li>
    <li>No user data is shared with third-party advertisers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Use of Firebase Analytics</h2>
  <p>We use Firebase Analytics to collect anonymized data about how users interact with our app. This includes device type, app usage patterns, and approximate geographic location derived from your IP address. This data helps us understand user behavior and improve app performance and features.</p>
  
  <p>You may choose to disable analytics tracking from the app’s settings page at any time.</p>
  
  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Besides Firebase, we do not use other third-party analytics or advertising services.</p>

  <h2>Data Protection</h2>
  <p>We take data security seriously. Personal details such as first name, last name, and username are encrypted before storage on our backend to protect your privacy. Email addresses are stored in cleartext only as needed for login and account recovery. We implement industry-standard security measures to safeguard your data.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted here.</p>
