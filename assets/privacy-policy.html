  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 28, 2025</p>

  <p>Vehicle Record Tracker (“we”, “our”, or “us”) values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use your information.</p>

  <h2>Use of Firebase Firestore</h2>
  <p>We use Firebase Firestore to manage account creation and authentication data. Firebase may collect metadata such as device information and usage logs as part of its service operation. No vehicle or fuel data is stored in Firebase Firestore.</p>
